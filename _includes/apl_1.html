<h1><a href="#">Machine Learning for Global Road Transportation Emissions Estimation</a></h1>
<p>I led a cross-disciplinary team to estimate road transportation emissions for 500 global cities as part of the <a href="https://climatetrace.org" target="_blank">Climate TRACE</a> coalition. 
    We built and deployed machine learning models on the Microsoft Planetary Computer using Dask and Xarray to efficiently process large-scale Sentinel-2 imagery. 
    Our results were presented at leading conferences, including the <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/EarthVision/papers/Mukherjee_Towards_Indirect_Top-Down_Road_Transport_Emissions_Estimation_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf" target="_blank">CVPR EarthVision Workshop</a> 
    and the <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/54" target="_blank">NeurIPS Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop</a></p>
