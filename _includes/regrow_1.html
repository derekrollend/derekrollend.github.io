<h1><a href="#">Transforming Remote-Sensing Prototypes to Production Pipelines</a></h1>
<h2>Streamlined Data Generation for Large-Scale Raster Products</h2>
<p>I led the transition of prototype remote-sensing algorithms into production-ready data pipelines, reducing data generation time from weeks to days. By integrating CI/CD processes and optimizing cloud deployment using Google Earth Engine, Docker, and Kubernetes, I significantly improved efficiency and consistency for large-scale raster data products derived from Sentinel-2 and LandSat imagery.</p>
