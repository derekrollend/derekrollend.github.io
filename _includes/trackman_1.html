<h1><a href="#">Real-time Baseball Player Tracking</a></h1>
<p>I led the design and development of a baseball player tracking system that combined modern deep learning models in combination with traditional 
    computer vision techniques to create a robust algorithm. The system fused video from multiple viewpoints to enhance accuracy and resolve occlusions, 
    allowing for precise monitoring of player movements and performance metrics during games.</p>
