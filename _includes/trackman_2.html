<h1><a href="#">Object Detection and Tracking for Golf</a></h1>
<p>I improved a golf ball detection and tracking system using a lightweight machine learning-based approach. By employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
   with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features, I significantly improved performance in varied lighting conditions compared to the previous 
   heuristic approach, while enabling real-time performance on an embedded platform.</p>
