# About Me

I’m Derek Rollend, a geospatial software engineer and data scientist specializing in building robust, scalable systems for remote sensing and machine learning applications. With over a decade of experience, I’ve led high-impact projects across a variety of industries, from environmental monitoring to post-disaster humanitarian assistance, utilizing cutting-edge computer vision and data science techniques.

I’m passionate about transforming prototype algorithms into production-grade tools, having collaborated extensively with data scientists and engineers to build pipelines that scale efficiently and deliver results in real-time. At [Regrow Ag](https://www.regrow.ag), I spearheaded the development of an online data pipeline capable of rapidly analyzing agricultural practices across multiple years, cutting down processing time from weeks to seconds. My work at [Climate TRACE](https://www.climatetrace.org) involved estimating road transportation emissions for 500 global cities using machine learning on geospatial data, culminating in a best paper award at the [CVPR EarthVision Workshop](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/EarthVision/papers/Mukherjee_Towards_Indirect_Top-Down_Road_Transport_Emissions_Estimation_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf).

<!-- # Featured Projects

- **Road Transportation Emissions Estimation**  
  A machine learning-based project estimating global city transportation emissions. Check out our [CVPR 2021 EarthVision paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021W/EarthVision/papers/Mukherjee_Towards_Indirect_Top-Down_Road_Transport_Emissions_Estimation_CVPRW_2021_paper.pdf).

- **Predicting Cholera Outbreaks Post-Hurricane**  
  Developed a remote sensing approach that significantly improved predictive accuracy for waterborne disease risk. View the research [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/10/4/48).

- **NO2 Trace Gas Measurement**  
  Machine learning algorithms reduced errors and runtime in hyperspectral trace gas measurements for environmental science. Learn more from the [AMS conference presentation](https://ams.confex.com/ams/102ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/396126).
